        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Bella Cardinal Diloreto. I was born on April 7<sup>th</sup> 1995. I <em>love</em> cats. Dogs are cool too. I enjoy nature and spend as much of my time in the outdoors. It makes me feel grounded and allows me to self reflect and connect with my thoughts. Besides that, I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie and ride a motorcycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently in my first year of Algonquin College's <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I always wanted to become a motion graphics designer. I applied to the Design Studies program years ago and discovered I had issues working creatively under deadlines and ultimately decided that design just wasn't for me. Apparently I changed my mind and here I am.
