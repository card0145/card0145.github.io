                    Community. This facility will provide our students with a place to break through perceptual barriers
                    in a welcoming, safe, inclusive and inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures
                    and abilities to spark a movement.

                    students can use and participate in all activities in the building. As for the facility, it will
                    cost Algonquin College $48.8 million.

                    building, opposite of the residence. The facility will be an estimated 100,000 square feet!
